This is a Java program that is able to solve mazes in the form of 2d arrays using a series of recursive methods. It uses a DFS algorithm to find solutions and can 
tell if there are no possible solutions for any given maze. Open characters are represented by 0, borders are represented by 1, the start point is represented 
by 2, and endpoint is represented by 9. The 2d arrays are hardcoded and can be edited before running.
